Most companies these days try to lure a customer on their platform by sending various promotional messages along with mouth-watering discounts. However, in this act to kill the competition, the industry ends up in flooding the customer’s phone with lots of messages and notifications. This not only frustrates the user, it also ends up in user discarding most of the messages without even taking a look what the message says. So how do we tackle the problem?

Problem Statement:

Try to stream line the masses for promotional messages. Unable to get user’s pattern of purchasing until he makes a sufficient transactions and use it target the audience accordingly.

The Solution

We have come up with a simple but elegant solution for the customer relationship management. To tackle this problem, the more the data we get about the user’s spending culture, we will be able predict with more accuracy about his likes and dislikes. So we have built up a simple API which collects the simple but useful data about the users spending. We plot the spending and get pattern out of it.

How does it work?

The API is given to all the partners (the merchants) and the API call is made with certain predefined parameters. This helps us in collecting the current order patterns of the user. We try to come up with his likes and dislikes as the data increases in our database. Given a sufficient time, the data about the user will be sufficient enough to predict his likes and dislikes and now the merchant can send targeted messages and notifications.
